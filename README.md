# Stone Paper Scissors – Python Game

This is a simple command-line Stone-Paper-Scissors game written in Python.  
It uses random number generation to simulate the computer's move.

### 🎮 How the game works
- 1 = Stone  
- 2 = Paper  
- 3 = Scissors  

The user selects one option, and the computer randomly chooses one.  
The program then compares both choices and prints the result:

- Draw  
- You win  
- You lose  

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- `random` module
